Green Smoothies are great. I take mine first thing in the morning, roughly an hour before my breakfast. I keep it simple to fit my busy lifestyle and make it a sustainable. It takes me less than 5 minutes for the entire prep and cleanup. Sometimes I prep and fill the blender with the ingredients, the night before in the refrigerator if I want to cut down those 5 minutes in the morning rush hour. 

A Simple Recipe:

1. Add a cup of water in your blender
2. Add 2-3 cups of your favorite greens. I prefer the Earthbound Farm Organic Power Deep Green Blend ( Spinach, Kale and Chard )
3. Add 1-2 pieces of your favorite Fruit. I prefer Strawberries or Nectarines
4. Blend on high setting for 30 seconds and Enjoy.

- The taste is Refreshing
- Reduces Cravings for Sugar and Caffeine
- Improves Digestion
- Increases Energy and lowers Stress
- Clears the Skin
- Reduces menstrual cramps greatly

With all these benefits, its a no-brainer to spend those few minutes everyday to enjoy a refreshing glass of green smoothie!
