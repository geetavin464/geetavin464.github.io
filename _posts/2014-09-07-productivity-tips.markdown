Simple, most effective time management technique.

Committing to work on the task for a fixed period of time. With no goals or a clear path in mind. Just spend that time and see where you get. My personal favorite is 5 minutes, sometimes even 2 minutes. It works great and I very often end up spending way more time without even knowing it. It sort of dissolves the inner resistance and worry about how far you get. Helps you circumvent procrastination and get right to it without the burden of perfectionism.

It can be used in the gym to fuel my workouts. I tell myself - Just 2 more minutes and you are good and I find myself on the treadmill for the next 20 minutes. It helps you overcome the initial resistance and gets you into the zone where you are riding the wave and don't look back.
