* Waterfall Model
  * More emphasis on planning

* Agile Manifesto
  * Embraces change unlike the waterfall
  * Values..
  * __Individuals and Interactions__ over *Processes and tools*
  * __Working Software__ over *Comprehensive Documentation*
  * __Customer Collaboration__ over *Contract Negotiation*
  * __Responding to Change__ over *Following a Plan*

* __Extreme Programming__
  * Pair Programming
  * Code Reviews
  * Unit Testing
  * Flat Hierarchy
  * There is nothing extreme in this approach IMHO

* Rapid Application Development
  * More Emphasis on development and less on planning
  * Emphasize the necessity of adjusting requirements based on knowledge gained as the project progresses
  * Prefer prototypes over design specifications

* Continuous Integration  
  * Practice where members of the team regularly integrate their work into one central repository
  * The teams use automated test & build tools to detect integration errors

* Continuous Deployment
  * Natural Extension of continuous integration. 

* Scrum 

* Lean Software Development

* Behavior Driven Development

* Cowboy Coding

* Minimalism
  
* Micro Innovation

* Release Early Release Often
  
* Quick & Dirty Programming
  * Crude Solution that is faster and easier
  * Solves the specific instance of the problem, rather than the larger general cause

* Technical Debt
  * Consequences of poor system design and regular maintanence
