* __Compiled__
  * Source Code -> Checker/Compiler -> Object Code -> Interpreter -> Output
  * Compiled languages are more efficient

* __Interpreted__
  * Source Code -> Checker -> Interpreter -> Output
  * If something goes wrong, the error message is in the language of the source code

* __Static Semantics__
  * A good programming language has very good static sematics
  * Does not allow statements like 7/abc and tells us it wrong

* __Instruction Set__
  * are like ingredients
  * Combine the instructions in clever ways to complex things

* __Fixed Program Computers__
  * Circuits were designed to do specific things and thats what they did

* __Scoping__
  * Lexical - You search for the variable in the current function, the function where the current function is defined and so on
  * Dynamic - You search for the variable in the current function, the function where the current function is called and so on
