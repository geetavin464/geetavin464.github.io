* __Computers__
  * Intelligence, according to merriam-webster is 'the ability to learn or understand things or to deal with new or difficult situations'
  * Computers are not intelligent
  * They are just very effective in doing some mundane tasks
  * Tasks like repetitively and conditionally run instructions on data
  * You learn a programming language to talk to a computer
  * Although they point you to semantic errors in the code, to a large extent they do not care about bug-freeness, efficiency, readability and organization
  * It is on the programmer to write efficient code, so the program runs using the minimum amount of computing resources
  * It is also on the programmer to write bug-free code so as to best serve the customer
  * It is also on the programmer to write well-organized, readable code, following the well-established design patterns, to make it easy for someone new to pick it up.
  
* __Primer__
  * Is the code unit tested?
  * Is it human readable?
  * Is it machine readable? aka Is it free from syntax errors?
  * Is it extensible? aka Is it scalable?
  * Does the business logic belong in the models?
  * Does the presentation logic belong in the controllers?
  * Is the reusable code extracted out of models & controllers?
  * Are edge/boundary cases appropriately handled?

* __Mantras__
  * DRY - Don't repeat yourself
