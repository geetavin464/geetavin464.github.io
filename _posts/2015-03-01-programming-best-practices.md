* Is the code unit tested?
* Is it human readable?
* Is it machine readable? aka Is it free from syntax errors?
* Is it extensible? aka Is it scalable?
* Does the business logic belong in the models?
* Does the presentation logic belong in the controllers?
* Is the reusable code extracted out of models & controllers?
* Are edge/boundary cases appropriately handled?
