> Apache is like Microsoft Word, it has a million options but you only need six. Nginx does those six things, and it does five of them 50 times faster than Apache.

* __Primer__
  * Nginx primarily deals with static files
  * Hands off other requests to another process
  * It does not have to know about Ruby or Python to handle a web request
  * It dispatches dynamic requests to another process (usually unicorn) and returns the results

* __Nginx Commands__
  * `service nginx status`
  * `sudo service nginx start`
  * `sudo service nginx stop`

* __How it works__
  * Master & Worker Processes
  * Master - read, evaluate and maintain worker processes
  * workers - actual processing of requests

* __Configuration__
  * `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` - Top level config file. Includes other files listed below
  * `/etc/nginx/conf.d` folder
  * `/etc/nginx/sites-available`
  * `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`

* __Server Block__
  * for http 
  * for https

* __Upstream__
  * Defines server groups
  * When it contains more than 1 server - indicates load balancing

* __Location__
  * Defines the file to be served for a particular url
  * You can also handle redirects

* __Resources__
