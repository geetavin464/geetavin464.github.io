* __Recursion__
  * Factorial - Recursive Implementation
  * Time complexity - O(n); Space Complexity - O(n)
  * Fibonacci - Recursive Implementation
  * Time Complexity - Lower Bound - 2^(n/2)
  * Upper bound - 2^n
  * O(2^n) - worst time complexity
  * Fib-Iterative.

* __Recursion with Memoization__
  * Time Complexity - O(n)
  * Memory Complexity - 

* __Terminology__
  * Time Complexity or Runtime Complexity
  * Space Complexity or Memory Complexity
  * Recursion Tree
  * Function Call stack
  * push & pop from memory stack
  * Maximum space consumed in the memory stack
  * Depth of the recursion tree - length of the longest path in the tree
