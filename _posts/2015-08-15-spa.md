* No page reload
* No transfer to other pages
* All code - html, css, js is retrieved in the first page load
* Dynamic Communication with the web server
* Originated somewhere around 2003~2005
* Thin Server Architecture - Server acts as an API
* Reduced dependency on server connectivity ( offline ). Behaves as a desktop app
* Hashed URL: #!
* page fragments are loaded from the server on demand
* There is no page navigation
* We only have state navigation
* We are moving away from page navigation and towards state navigation
*
