* __Most Used Services__
  * EC2, RDS, S3, Route 53

* __Billing Criteria__
  * Instance Class, Running Time, IOPS, Storage, Backup Storage & Retention Period, Data Transfer

* __IAM - Identity & Access Management__
  * Manage users and permissions
  * You can use MFA Multi Factor Authentication to login

* __Independent Scalability__
  * When you buy a server, you get CPU, Memory, Storage, IOPS bundled together, which can be scaled independently

* __RDS__
  * No ssh access to RDS instances
  * You can only access the mysql server
  * Manages backups, software patching, automatic failure detection, recovery from the synchronous secondary instance
  * You can also create snapshots for restoration purposes

* __Multi AZ deployment__
  * This option provides failover support
  * Maintains a synchronous secondary instance/replica

* __CloudWatch__
  * To monitor the performance and health of the instances

* __Monitoring Best Practices__
  * Make it a priority
  * Be able to easily debug multi point failures
  * What are your goals for monitoring?
  * What resources do we monitor?
  * Who should be notified when something goes wrong?
  * Establish a baseline based on historic data
  * As you detect anamolies, devise methods to address them

* __Monitoring Metrics__
  * CPU Utilization
  * Disk IO
  * Network Utilization

* __EC2 Status Checks__
  * System Status Checks
  * Instance Status Checks

* __Elastic IP__
  * Elastic IP is a public IP. An account can only have upto 5 EIPs, because ipv4 addresses are a scarce commodity
  * EIPs are used to mask the failure of an instance by rapidly remapping to another instance
  * For all internal communication use endpoints or DNS hostnames
  * You can associate an EIP to and from instances until you chose to release it

* __Access to an instance__
  * You lose access, if you lose the private key

* __Security Groups__
  * A security group has rules
  * A rule is an IP address range
  * A group can have upto 20 rules
  * RDS & EC2 instances have security groups

* __Route 53__
  * DNS Service
  * Provides secure reliable routing to instances
  * Update name servers & record sets for hosted zones
  * Maintains hosted zones which is a collection of resource record sets
