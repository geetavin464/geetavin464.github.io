* __Query__
  * `select * from employees where first_name = "tom" ORDER BY field1 desc LIMIT 10`
  * `select * from employees where age > 25`
  * `select * from employees where first_name LIKE '%Robert%'`
  * `select * from employees where dob IS NULL`
  * `select * from employees where dob IS NOT NULL`
  * `select * from employees where first_name IN ("Tom", "Harry")` - check from array 
  * `select * from employees where first_name NOT IN ("Tom", "Harry")` - Inverse check from array
  * `AND  OR` to join the conditions
  * `select * from employees join deparments on employees.department_id = department.id'

* __Configuration & Connection__
  * `/etc/my.cnf`
  * `/etc/mysql/my.cnf`
  * `mysql -h host -u username -p passwd`
  * `history` for past commands

* __Data Manipulation__
  * `UPDATE employees SET street_address="40 prince ct" where first_name="Harry" and last_name="Emerson"`
  * `delete` vs `truncate` - truncate is faster

* __Optimization__
  * Check the slow_query.log
  * Use `explain` statement

* __Maintenance__
  * `mysqlheck -h host -u username -ppassword tables tablename --auto-repair`
