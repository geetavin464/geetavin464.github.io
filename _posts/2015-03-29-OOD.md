* __Inheritance__
  * A class is like a blueprint
  * A class has list of attributes.
  * Attributes are also called instance variables. They are prefixed with an `@` in ruby
  * An attribute could also be an instance of another class
  * They are protected and cannot be directly accessed.
  * To get access to the attributes outside of the class, you can define getters/setters
  * `attr_reader` creates a getter instance method
  * `attr_writer` creates a setter instance method
  * `attr_accessor` creates both
  * A class also has a list of methods, which define its behavior and a constructor
  * These methods are the interface for the class and the user
  * Constructor is invoked, whenever you create a new car object
  * `my_car = Car.new`

* __Encapsulation__
  * All data is private
  * All methods are public
  * To make instance variable readable from outside, you use `:attr_reader`
  * To make them writable, you use `:attr_writer`

* __Polymorphism__
  *
