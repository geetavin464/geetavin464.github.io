* __Problem Solving Techniques__
  * Difficult Problem - When the path to the solution is not immediately apparent
  * Make a guess - Evaluate each guess
  * Heuristics - Rules intended to help you explore the solution space and converge to the solution
  * Define the problem - A problem clearly stated is a problem half solved
  * Abstract - The big picture might help you identify causes in other areas
  * Divide & Conquer - Divide the system into components and examine each

* __Troubleshooting__
  * Repair failed products or processes

* __Steps in Troubleshooting__
  * Examine the symptoms of malfunction
  * Identify the source
  * Fix it 
  * Check if the system is operational
  * Analyze the causes of the malfunction
  * Make the system robust against future failures

* __Identifying the source__
  * KISS - Check the simple things first
  * Always assume multi point failure ie non singular cause
  * Focus on recent changes
  * Process of Elimination - Elimiante each potential cause until you find the source

* __Prepare in Advance__
  * Know the expected system behavior
  * Develop troubleshooting procedures in advances
  * Allows for sufficient thinking ahead of time

* __Creative Problem Solving__
  * Start with the assumption that a perfect logical reasonable solution exists
  * Timeboxing - Commit to work a small amount of time, as little as 5 minutes. Most often you will end up spending much longer. Helps overcome procrastination. 
  * Journaling - Putting it on paper avoids circular, repetitive thinking. Helps overcome the limitations of conscious mind's working memory.
  * Put it on hold - A solution might pop out when you least expect it
  * Persistance - Refer to the quote by Albert Einstein above. 
  * Problems exist to help you grow, not to beat you down. They are like dumbbells. Start with the lightest one.
