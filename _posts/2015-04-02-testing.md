* __Purpose & Practice__
  * Responding to change with confidence
  * Red, Green, Refactor
  * Red - Write a test that fails
  * Green - Write the minimum amount of code to make it pass
  * Refactor - Improve the code 

* __Rspec Matchers__
  * `expect(sthg).to eq(3)` - Equality
  * `expect(sthg).to be <=2` - Comparison
  * `expect(sthg).to match regex` - Regular Expression
  * `expect(object).to be_a Float` - Type checking

* __Stubs and Mocks__
  * Stub: Fake implementation of a method
  * Mock: Fake implementation of an object
  * Double: Represent an object hat stands in for another object
  * `a_stub = instance_double("A_class")`
  * `allow(a_stub).to receive(:a_method).and_return(:sthg)`
  * `a_mock = double(:product)`
  * `expect(a_mock).to receive(:price)`
