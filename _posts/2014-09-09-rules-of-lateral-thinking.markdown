Lateral Thinking is what differentiates humans from computers. You can never compete with computers in logical/sequential/vertical thinking. Focus on niche, the ability to think outside the box. It is what sparks that funny remark that cracks everyone up. It is what tickles the brain by activating new neural pathways.

Our structured lives do not pose a pressing need for lateral thinking (unless you are CSI agent). But conscious exercise of it has many benefits.

Rule#1 **Reject the obvious.**

This is the heart of lateral thinking ability. Reject the obvious. Think outside the box.

Rule#2 **Solve lateral thinking puzzles**

Usually a crutial part of the story is deliberately masked in these puzzles.  You have to put on your imagination hat and creative shoes to reconstruct it.

Rule#3 **Imaginative Reading, Watching**

When you are reading a book, article or watching a show, pause it at a crucial point. Put the book aside and try to imagine how things are going to turn up. 

Rule#4: **Apply in real life**

In your everyday conversations with friends, co-workers try to think of quirky responses that would get a few laughs.
