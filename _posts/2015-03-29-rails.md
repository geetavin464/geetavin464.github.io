* __Benefits__
  * Huge leap in developer productivity
  * Reduced time to market
  * One can build and deploy an app in a day

* __Scaling & Scalability__
  * Scaling is an architecture concern
  * Architecture, Databases, Caching, Queues, CDNs, Load Balancers
  * Not too much to do with the performance of a language or a framework
  * Hulu is handling almost 10M unique visitors per month

* __Data Modelling__
  * Associations
  * Polymorphic Associations - A model belongs to more than 1 other models on a single association. 
  * Self Referential Association
  * Single Table Inheritance
  * Eager Loading - loads the associations in advances `includes`
  * Lazy Loading
  * N+1 Query Problem

* __Query Interface__
  * pure string condition - not recommended. May cause sql injection security threat
  * array condition - recommended
  * hash condition - readable

* __CommandLine__
  * `rails c --sandbox` - does not make any changes
  * `rails s`
  * `rails generate`
  * `rails dbconsole`
  * `rails new appname`

* __rake__
  * Short for ruby make
  * Runs administrative tasks using rakefile
  * Tasks have the file extension `.rake`
  * `rake -T` lists all the different tasks available
  * `rake namespace::taskname`
  * rake tasks can have callbacks
  * rspec, capistrano are built on rake
  * Avoid writing complex logic in tasks. Call model methods instead.
  * `rake` vs `rails r` - rake does not boot rails. Since booting rails is expensive, use rails runner only if required
  * Alternative - Thor

* __Routing__
  * Rails routing is centered around resources 
  * You can add constraints to specify protocol and subdomain

* __Levels of logging__
  * `:debug, :info, :warn, :error, :fatal`
