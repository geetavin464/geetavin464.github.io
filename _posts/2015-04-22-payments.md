* __Basics__
  * v.zero comes baked in with paypal

* __client SDK__
  * braintree.js
  * Allows payment details to be collected

* __server SDK__
  * Manages requests to braintree SDK
  * 

* __Client token__
  * server generates the client token
  * contaings configuration and authorization information
  * generated for every customer request
  * cannot be reused
  * authenticates the client to talk directly to braintree
  * client obtains the client token, intializes the client SDK
  * after it succeeds, the client will generate a payment_method_nonce
  * `@client_token = Braintree::ClientToken.generate(:customer_id => customer_id)`
  * 

* __payment_method_nonce__
  * string returned by the client sdk
  * to represent a payment method
  * customer payment method details
  * sent to the server
  * expires after 24 hours
  * hidden input field in the form
  * Server uses this to create transactions, customers, vaults

* __Client__
  * add the drop in UI
  * add braintree.js form
  * braintree.setup must be called after the drop in container is created
  * Receives the payment_method_nonce from the payment details provided by the user & sends it to the server
  * server closes the loop by using the pmn to create a transaction

* __Server Setup__
  * sandbox API credentials
  * merchant_id, public key, private key
  * `gem "braintree"`
  * Configure the environment and API credentials

* __Sandbox Mode__
  * provides test values for user payment info
  * static payment_method_nonce
  * several types of nonces are available

* __Live Mode__
  * production api credentials
  * create a couple low value sales
  * make sure the funds are deposited in your bank account
  * few days after they are settled
  *
