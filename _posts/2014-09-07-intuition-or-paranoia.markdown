Did you ever find yourself in a situation that made you wonder if what you were experiencing was infact intuition or just paramoia?

According to the dictionary, intuition is a natural ability or power that makes it possible to know something without any proof or evidence. A feeling that guides a person to act a certain way, without fully understanding why.

Paranoia on the other hand is an intense fear or suspicion of hostility, which again is also baseless or without any proof.

So how do you tell the difference? Based on the experiences of many people - here is a question to ask yourself in such situations. Does the feeling inspire you to act or to react ?

Intuition is gentle and inspires action, whereas paranoia is intense with emotions and inspires reaction. Reaction in the form of excess anxiety and nervousness. In short intuition radiates out and paranoia radiates in.

The moment you are aware of it, you know when to ignore the dark cloud of paranoia and let it pass. Also when to act on the gentle inspiration of intuition.
