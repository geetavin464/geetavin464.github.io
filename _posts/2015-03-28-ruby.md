* __Implementations__
  * MRI, YARV, Jruby, Rubinius

* __Features__
  * Duck Typing - An object's type is determined by its data and methods
  * Open Classes
  * Meta Programming - Modify classes and methods at runtime
  * Inheritance - Does not support multiple inheritance, but provides modules and mixins
  * Multiple paradigms - supports multiple paradigms like oop and functional

* __Garbage Collection__
  * is a fancy word for memory management
  * Does allocate, identify and reclaim memory
  * Ruby provides automated memory management

* __Enumerable__
  * Module/Mixin
  * Provides the class with several search, sort methods
  * The class must provide an 'each' method, which yields successive elements and the <=> aka spaceship operator

* __Executing Ruby Code__
  * `ruby main_file.rb` - on terminal
  * `cmd + B`- on sublime text

* __String vs Symbol__
  * Symbols are immutable

* __Require__
  * `require awesome`
  * File extension is not required
  * Works with absolute and relative paths
  * Loads the file only the first time it is encountered

* __Load__
  * `load amazing.rb`
  * File extension is required
  * Works with absolute and relative paths
  * Loads the file every single time it encounters the statement
  * Does not check if the file is already loaded
  * Good for exploratory code loading
  * Make changes to the file and load them again in a single session

* __Include__
  * Modules and reusable code

* __Block__
  * Piece of code enclosed between { } or do end
  * Passed as parameter to methods, which can then execute the block anytime using the `yield` keyword
  * Blocks can take parameters 1 for array and 2 for hash passed between the || characters

* __Proc__
  * Proc is a piece of code stored in a variable
  * Variable can then be passed to a method

* __Lambda__
  * Piece of code that takes an argument
  * Used to define scopes in rails models

* __Variable Arguments__
  * 
  ``` 
  def compute_result(*param)
    # Do something
  end

  compute_result(1,2,3,4)
  ```
