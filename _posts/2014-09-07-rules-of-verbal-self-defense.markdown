All of us are bound to have our share of intimidating people in life. They are found everywhere, in the subway, on the street, at a crowded concert, at a family gathering or at work. 

A bully is someone who abuses his power to intimidate or hurt or manipulate someone. What is more alarming is when a seemingly nice person turns into a manipulator and catches you offguard. Confidence, Assertiveness, Speaking Up and Questioning are the qualities that keep the perpetrator tendencies in these people on check. 

**Rule#1** You do not need sharp wit and clever comebacks to retaliate a bully. You don't have to play the same dirty game. A simple "What makes you say that?" by itself sends a strong message that you are not going to let things slide and you will call them out if necessary.

**Rule#2** If that does not scare them off, simply point it out, by saying "Thats not a nice thing to say" or "You are being very harsh/rude/mean/judgemental" or "You seem to have a lot of pre-conceived notion about someone/something"

**Rule#3** If their intentions are really innocent, you could laugh it off because Remember - You were civil all the time.
