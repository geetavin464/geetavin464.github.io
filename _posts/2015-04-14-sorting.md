* __Terminlogy__
  * In place Sorting Algorithm - 
  * Stable Sorting Algorithm - A sorting algorithm is stable, if it preserves the order of original records with equal keys
  * Internal Sorting Algorithm - A sorting algorithm is internal, if it works on lists in the internal memory
  * External Sorting Algorithm - A sorting algorithm is external, if it works on data in external files
  * Measure of input size - Length of array
  * Basic Operation - Comparison of elements
