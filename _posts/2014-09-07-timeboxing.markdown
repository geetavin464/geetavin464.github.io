Simple, most effective time management technique.

Committing to work on the task for a fixed period of time. With no goals or a clear path in mind. Just spend that time and see where you get. My personal favorite is 5 minutes, sometimes even 2 minutes. It works great and I very often end up spending way more time without even knowing it. It sort of dissolves the inner resistance and worry about how far you get. Helps you circumvent procrastination and get right to it without the burden of perfectionism.

I use this technique in different areas of my life. To stretch my workout in the gym or even to be there in the first place. To put away the take-out menu and actually make something fun in the kitchen. To get out and run those long due errands. Works like a charm every single time.
